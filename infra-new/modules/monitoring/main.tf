# ECS ALARMS — per-service CPU and memory monitoring
# =============================================================================
# ECS Fargate reports CPU and memory utilization to CloudWatch automatically.
# We create one CPU alarm and one memory alarm per service (8 services × 2 = 16 alarms).

#   - LLM Worker: CPU-heavy (orchestrating Bedrock calls)
#   - Model Worker: memory-heavy (ML inference data)
#   - API Service: both (handling HTTP + DB queries)
#
# If all services shared one alarm, a spike in one service could be masked
# by low utilization in others.
