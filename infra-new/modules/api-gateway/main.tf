# WEBSOCKET API — persistent bidirectional connection for real-time updates
# =============================================================================
# API Gateway manages WebSocket connections for us:
#   - Handles connection lifecycle (open, close, keep-alive)
#   - Scales automatically (thousands of concurrent connections)
#   - Assigns each connection a unique ID
#
# Our app uses this to push real-time updates to the frontend:
#   1. Client connects via wss://xxx.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev
#   2. Backend subscribes to Redis pub/sub ("entry posted", "transactions ready")
#   3. When an update arrives, backend calls the Management API to push to connected clients
#
# The client never polls — updates arrive instantly over the open WebSocket.

# MOCK INTEGRATION — placeholder backend for all routes
# =============================================================================
# A MOCK integration returns a static response without calling any backend.
# We use this as scaffolding — the real integration (Lambda or HTTP to the API
# Service) is wired when the application is built.
#
# For $connect, the MOCK must return 200 or the connection is rejected.
# For $disconnect and $default, the response doesn't matter (informational).
#
# To switch to a real backend later, replace integration_type with:
#   - "AWS_PROXY" for Lambda
#   - "HTTP_PROXY" for an HTTP endpoint (e.g. ALB)
