# =============================================================================
# ROUTE53 A RECORD (ALIAS) — api.autobook.tech → ALB
# =============================================================================
# This DNS record maps a human-readable domain (api.autobook.tech) to the ALB.
# When someone visits https://api.autobook.tech, DNS resolves to the ALB's IP,
# the ALB forwards the request to an ECS container running the API service.
#
# We use an ALIAS A record (not a CNAME) because:
#   1. Free — Route53 doesn't charge for alias queries to AWS resources
#   2. Faster — returns the ALB's IP directly (no second DNS lookup)
#   3. Health-aware — Route53 checks ALB health automatically
#   4. Works at zone apex — CNAMEs can't be used for root domains (DNS spec)

  type    = "A"                                            # A record (returns IP addresses)

  # Alias block — tells Route53 "resolve this to the ALB's current IPs"
  # Unlike a regular A record (static IP), alias automatically updates when ALB IPs change
