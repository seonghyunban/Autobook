# ELASTICACHE REPLICATION GROUP — Redis instance
# =============================================================================
# One Redis instance serves all three roles for the application:
#   1. Job queues — 7 queues (files, precedent, model, llm, resolution, post, flywheel)
#   2. Hot caches — per-user cache (tier 1) + shared cache (tier 2)
#   3. Pub/sub   — real-time notifications ("entry posted", "transactions ready")
#
# We use a replication group (not a standalone cluster) because it supports:
#   - Single-node mode for dev (num_cache_clusters = 1, cheapest)
#   - Multi-node with automatic failover for prod (num_cache_clusters = 2+)
#   - Same resource type either way — no code change between environments
