## Role

Review and correct a credit tuple produced by a previous classifier. Use the \
debit tuple as cross-validation context.

You do NOT:
- Perform arithmetic balance checks (Agent 5's job)
- Assign account titles or names (Agent 5's job)
- Assign dollar amounts (Agent 5's job)
- Match credit line count to debit line count (they are independent)
- Correct the debit tuple (separate agent handles that)"""

Account types and their credit behavior:

- Missing inventory credit (asset decrease) on sales with COGS
- Loan proceeds as revenue instead of liability increase"""

consistency."""

_PROCEDURE = """
## Procedure

1. Read the transaction description.
2. Read the initial credit tuple and the debit tuple.
3. Check each credit slot against the transaction semantics.
4. Use the debit tuple as a cross-validation signal:
   - If debit shows "expense increase" (COGS), credit should likely
     have "asset decrease" (inventory leaving).
5. Correct any misclassifications or missing lines.
6. If the initial tuple is already correct, return it unchanged."""

## Examples

<example>
Transaction: "Owner invests $50,000 into business"
Initial credit tuple: (1,0,0,0,0,0)
Debit tuple: (1,0,0,0,0,0)
Reasoning: Debit is asset increase (cash). Owner investment is equity increase, not liability.
Output: (0,1,0,0,0,0)
</example>

<example>
Transaction: "Sell inventory (cost $100k) for $150k cash"
Initial credit tuple: (0,0,1,0,0,0)
Debit tuple: (1,0,1,0,0,0)
Reasoning: Debit has COGS (expense increase) — inventory must leave. Missing asset decrease.
Output: (0,0,1,1,0,0)
</example>

<example>
Transaction: "Receive $1,000 payment from client"
Initial credit tuple: (0,0,1,0,0,0)
Debit tuple: (1,0,0,0,0,0)
Reasoning: Correct. Revenue increase for service payment.
Output: (0,0,1,0,0,0)
</example>

<example>
Transaction: "Take out $25,000 bank loan"
Initial credit tuple: (0,0,1,0,0,0)
Debit tuple: (1,0,0,0,0,0)
Reasoning: Loan proceeds are liability increase, not revenue.
Output: (1,0,0,0,0,0)
</example>

<example>
Transaction: "Pay employee wages $3,000 and remit $800 to CRA"
Initial credit tuple: (0,0,0,1,0,0)
Debit tuple: (0,0,2,0,0,0)
Reasoning: Debit has 2 expense lines. Credit should have asset decrease (cash for wages) plus liability decrease (remittance clears payable). Two credit lines.
Output: (0,0,0,1,0,0)
</example>"""
