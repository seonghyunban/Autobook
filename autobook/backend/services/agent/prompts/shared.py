## Domain Knowledge (IFRS)

Double-entry rules:
- Every entry must have total debits = total credits.
- All amounts must be positive (> 0).

Debit/credit effects:
- Debit increases: Asset, Dividend, Expense
- Debit decreases: Liability, Equity, Revenue
- Credit increases: Liability, Equity, Revenue
- Credit decreases: Asset, Dividend, Expense
- Dividends (owner withdrawals) behave like expenses.

Classification principles:
- Count each economically distinct event as a separate line.
- When face value and present value differ, count the contra \
account as its own line.
- Combine into a single line when components share the same \
account and same treatment.
- Classify by business purpose, not item description.
- Non-depreciable items must use distinct accounts from \
depreciable items. Land is non-depreciable; site improvements \
(fencing, walkways, streetlights) are depreciable PP&E. \
Permanent landscaping that becomes part of the land (grading, \
drainage, established plantings) is Land.
- Contra accounts are classified as decreases of the related \
account, not increases of a different account type.
- Decommissioning, restoration, and similar obligatory costs are \
capitalized into the related PP&E asset's carrying amount \
(IAS 16.16(c)), not as a separate asset line.
- Manufacturing costs are product costs capitalized to inventory, \
not period expenses.
- Payroll remittance with employer matching: employee withholdings \
(previously recorded as liability) are a liability decrease; \
employer matching contributions are a new expense, not part of \
the prior liability.
- Advertising and promotional expenditure shall be recognized as \
an expense when incurred — never capitalize (IAS 38.69).
- Materials purchased for R&D use are expensed when acquired \
(IAS 38.126). Only capitalize if purchased for general inventory \
with no stated R&D purpose.
- Buyer-side tax: recoverable tax on purchases is an asset \
(Input Tax Credit Receivable / Current tax assets), not a liability. \
Only the seller records tax payable.

Conventional terms:
- "paid", "settled", "remitted" — cash unless method stated
- "on account", "on credit" — accounts payable
- "accrued", "recognized" — liability recorded, not paid
- "prepaid", "advance" — asset, not expense
- "earned", "delivered", "performed" — revenue recognized
- "declared" — payable (not paid), "distributed" — paid
- "loss", "written off", "destroyed" — uninsured expense
- "repurchased", "bought back" — treasury stock unless \
"cancelled" or "retired" stated
- "converted X to Y" — book value at stated amounts
- "refinanced" — old obligation extinguished, new one created
- "deposit received" — liability (unearned), not revenue
- "discounted at the bank" — ambiguous between derecognition \
and collateralized borrowing

Tax categories:
- Taxable: purchases/sales of goods or services, rent, utilities, \
advertising, professional fees
- Not taxable: equity, loans, payroll, provisions, depreciation, \
write-offs, casualty losses, prepayments/deposits

Calculation conventions:
- Discount and interest calculations use actual/365 day-count \
convention (not 30/360). Example: $100,000 at 15% for 40 days = \
$100,000 × 0.15 × 40/365.
- For multi-step calculations (PV, amortization), compute each \
component separately and sum. Do not skip terms.

IFRS taxonomy categories (for classifiers):
- Assets: Land, Buildings, Machinery, Motor vehicles, Office equipment, \
Fixtures and fittings, Construction in progress, Site improvements, \
Right-of-use assets, Goodwill, Intangible assets, Investment property, \
Investments — equity method, Investments — FVTPL, Investments — FVOCI, \
Deferred tax assets, Non-current loans receivable, Long-term deposits, \
Non-current prepayments, Inventories — raw materials, \
Inventories — work in progress, Inventories — finished goods, \
Inventories — merchandise, Cash and cash equivalents, Trade receivables, \
Contract assets, Prepaid expenses, Tax assets, \
Short-term loans receivable, Short-term deposits, Restricted cash
- Liabilities: Trade payables, Accrued liabilities, \
Employee benefits payable, Warranty provisions, \
Legal and restructuring provisions, Tax liabilities, \
Short-term borrowings, Current lease liabilities, Deferred income, \
Contract liabilities, Dividends payable, Long-term borrowings, \
Non-current lease liabilities, Pension obligations, \
Decommissioning provisions, Deferred tax liabilities
- Equity: Issued capital, Share premium, Retained earnings, \
Treasury shares, Revaluation surplus, Translation reserve, Hedging reserve
- Revenue/Income: Revenue from sale of goods, \
Revenue from rendering of services, Interest income, Dividend income, \
Share of profit of associates, Gains (losses) on disposals, \
Fair value gains (losses), Foreign exchange gains (losses), \
Rental income, Government grant income
- Expenses: Cost of sales, Employee benefits expense, \
Depreciation expense, Amortisation expense, Impairment loss, \
Advertising expense, Professional fees expense, Travel expense, \
Utilities expense, Repairs and maintenance expense, Services expense, \
Insurance expense, Communication expense, Transportation expense, \
Warehousing expense, Occupancy expense, Interest expense, \
Income tax expense, Property tax expense, Payroll tax expense, \
Research and development expense, Entertainment expense, \
Donations expense, Royalty expense, Casualty loss, Penalties and fines
- Dividends: Dividends declared

Source of truth:
- The transaction text overrides LLM knowledge for amounts, \
rates, and accounting policies.
- If no tax is mentioned in the transaction, do not add tax lines.
- Stated amounts: use exactly as written, do not decompose.
- Stated tax rates: use the stated rate, not defaults.
- Stated accounting policy: follow it, do not apply alternatives."""

## System Knowledge

The pipeline classifies each journal entry side into 6 directional slots. \
Each slot contains a list of classified lines, where each line has a \
reason (why this line exists) and a category (from the IFRS taxonomy above). \
The number of lines per slot = the number of journal lines of that type. \
Same category = combine into one line. Different category = separate lines.

Debit slots:
- asset_increase: Asset balance goes up
- dividend_increase: Dividend/drawing balance goes up
- expense_increase: Expense balance goes up
- liability_decrease: Liability balance goes down
- equity_decrease: Equity balance goes down
- revenue_decrease: Revenue balance goes down

Credit slots:
- liability_increase: Liability balance goes up
- equity_increase: Equity balance goes up
- revenue_increase: Revenue balance goes up
- asset_decrease: Asset balance goes down
- dividend_decrease: Dividend/drawing balance goes down
- expense_decrease: Expense balance goes down

Pipeline architecture:
- Layer 1 (parallel): ambiguity detector, complexity detector, \
debit classifier, credit classifier, tax specialist
- Layer 2 (conditional): if flagged → decision maker → entry drafter; \
if clear → entry drafter directly"""
