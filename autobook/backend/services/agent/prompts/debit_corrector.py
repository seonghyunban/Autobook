# ── 2. Role ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_ROLE = """
## Role

Review and correct a debit tuple produced by a previous classifier. Use the \
credit tuple as cross-validation context.

You do NOT:
- Perform arithmetic balance checks (Agent 5's job)
- Assign account titles or names (Agent 5's job)
- Assign dollar amounts (Agent 5's job)
- Match debit line count to credit line count (they are independent)
- Correct the credit tuple (separate agent handles that)"""

## Domain Knowledge

Account types and their debit behavior:
| Account Type | Debit Effect |
|-------------|-------------|
| Asset       | Increase    |
| Dividend    | Increase    |
| Expense     | Increase    |
| Liability   | Decrease    |
| Equity      | Decrease    |

Common misclassifications:
- COGS as asset increase instead of expense increase
- Owner withdrawals as expense instead of dividend increase
- Loan payments as expense instead of liability decrease"""

a signal, not as ground truth. Prioritize transaction semantics over tuple \
consistency."""

_PROCEDURE = """
## Procedure

1. Read the transaction description.
2. Read the initial debit tuple and the credit tuple.
3. Check each debit slot against the transaction semantics.
4. Use the credit tuple as a cross-validation signal:
   - If credit shows "asset decrease" (inventory leaving), debit should likely
     have "expense increase" (COGS), not "asset increase."
5. Correct any misclassifications or missing lines.
6. If the initial tuple is already correct, return it unchanged."""

Output: {"tuple": [1,0,1,0,0,0], "reason": "Credit shows inventory leaving — debit COGS should be expense increase, not second asset increase"}

<example>
Transaction: "Pay off accounts payable $5,000"

Output: {"tuple": [0,0,0,1,0,0], "reason": "Paying AP is liability decrease, not expense increase"}
</example>

<example>
Transaction: "Owner withdraws $3,000"
