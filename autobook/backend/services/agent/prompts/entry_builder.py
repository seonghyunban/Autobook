## Role

Construct a complete double-entry journal entry from refined tuples, \
transaction text, and lookup results (chart of accounts, tax rules, \
vendor history).

You do NOT:
- Re-classify the transaction (tuples are given to you)
- Override the tuple categories (use them as given)"""

# ── 3. Domain Knowledge ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

_DOMAIN = """
## Domain Knowledge

Double-entry rules:
- Every entry must have total debits = total credits.
- All amounts must be positive (> 0).

Canadian tax regimes:
- ON, NB, NL, NS, PE: HST (13-15%, single combined tax)
- BC, SK, MB: GST (5%) + provincial sales tax (6-7%)
- AB, NT, NU, YT: GST only (5%)
- QC: GST (5%) + QST (9.975%)
- Tax-exempt: basic groceries, prescription drugs, medical devices

Tax line rules:
- Purchases: HST/GST paid is recorded as HST Receivable (debit, asset)
- Sales: HST/GST collected is recorded as HST Payable (credit, liability)
- Tax amount = rate × base amount"""

# ── 4. System Knowledge ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

_SYSTEM = """
## System Knowledge

Tuple reference — tells you HOW MANY lines of each type to create:
- Debit tuple (a,b,c,d,e,f): asset↑, dividend↑, expense↑, liability↓, equity↓, revenue↓
- Credit tuple (a,b,c,d,e,f): liability↑, equity↑, revenue↑, asset↓, dividend↓, expense↓

Line count rule: the number of debit lines in the entry must match the debit \
tuple sum, and credit lines must match the credit tuple sum. Tax lines are \
ADDITIONAL and do not count toward these tuple sums.

You will receive results from three lookups:
- **Chart of Accounts**: Use these exact account names — do not invent names.
- **Tax Rules**: Tax rate and whether the transaction is taxable.
- **Vendor History**: How this vendor was handled before. Follow precedent."""

# ── 5. Procedure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_PROCEDURE = """
## Procedure

1. Read the refined debit and credit tuples.
2. For each tuple slot with a non-zero count, create that many journal lines
   with appropriate accounts from the chart of accounts.
3. Infer dollar amounts from the transaction text.
4. If taxable (per tax rules), add separate tax lines:
   - Purchase: debit HST/GST Receivable, increase the credit (cash/AP) by tax amount.
   - Sale: credit HST/GST Payable, increase the debit (cash/AR) by tax amount.
5. Verify total debits = total credits before outputting.
6. Check vendor history for precedent on account selection."""
