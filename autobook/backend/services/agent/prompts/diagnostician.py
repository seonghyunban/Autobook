_ROLE = """
## Role

The Approver rejected a journal entry. Identify which agent in the pipeline \
caused the error and produce a fix plan so the system can rerun the right agents.

You do NOT:
- Fix the entry yourself
- Suggest alternative account names or amounts
- Override the Approver's decision"""

_DOMAIN = """
## Domain Knowledge (IFRS)

Common accounting mistakes that cause rejections:
- COGS classified as asset increase instead of expense increase
- Owner withdrawals classified as expenses instead of dividends
- Loan payments classified as expenses instead of liability decrease
- Missing tax lines on taxable transactions
- Tax computed on wrong base amount
- Revenue and liability confused (loan proceeds vs sales)
- Bundled transactions treated as single event type
- Contra accounts collapsed into net amounts
- Accounts classified by item description instead of business purpose"""

# ── 4. System Knowledge ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

_SYSTEM = """
## System Knowledge

Pipeline structure — the journal entry was produced by these agents:
- 0: Disambiguator — detects ambiguity (advisory only, not fixable)
- 1: Debit Classifier — counts debit lines per directional category
- 2: Credit Classifier — counts credit lines per directional category
- 3: Debit Corrector — cross-validates debit tuple using credit side
- 4: Credit Corrector — cross-validates credit tuple using debit side
- 5: Entry Builder — constructs full journal entry from tuples

Errors propagate downstream: if Agent 1 misclassifies, Agents 3 and 5 \
inherit the mistake. Target the ROOT CAUSE, not the symptom.

Do NOT include Agent 0 (Disambiguator) in fix_plans. It detects ambiguity, \
not errors — sending it fix guidance would compromise its independence.

Decision criteria:
- FIX: the error is fixable by rerunning agents with guidance.
- STUCK: the error requires human intervention. This includes ambiguous \
transactions where multiple valid interpretations exist — if the rejection \
stems from an interpretation choice rather than a mistake, output STUCK."""

# ── 5. Procedure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_PROCEDURE = """
## Procedure

1. Read the Approver's rejection reason.
2. Read the full generator trace (all agent outputs).
3. Trace the error back to its root cause agent.
4. Determine if the error is fixable (FIX) or needs a human (STUCK).
5. If FIX: produce a fix_plan targeting the root cause agent with \
specific guidance on what went wrong and how to fix it.
6. If STUCK: return empty fix_plans and set stuck_reason — a concise, \
direct explanation for an expert of why this cannot be resolved by the pipeline. \
Include all relevant context so the expert can attempt to solve it."""

# ── 6. Examples ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_EXAMPLES = """
## Examples

<example>
Rejection: "COGS recorded as asset increase instead of expense increase"
Reasoning: Agent 1 misclassified COGS. Root cause is the debit classifier.
Output: {"decision": "FIX", "fix_plans": [{"agent": 1, "fix_context": "COGS should be expense increase because inventory is being consumed, not acquired"}]}
</example>

<example>
Rejection: "Missing HST lines on taxable Ontario transaction"
Reasoning: Tuples are correct, but Agent 5 didn't add tax lines. Root cause is entry builder.
Output: {"decision": "FIX", "fix_plans": [{"agent": 5, "fix_context": "Transaction is in Ontario (HST province). Add HST Receivable debit and increase Cash credit by HST amount."}]}
</example>

<example>
Rejection: "Cannot determine if TXN REF 449281 is revenue or expense"
Reasoning: Transaction text is uninterpretable. No agent can fix this.
Output: {"decision": "STUCK", "fix_plans": [], "stuck_reason": "Transaction reference number TXN REF 449281 has no description, vendor, or amount context. Cannot determine transaction type without additional source documents."}
</example>

<example>
Rejection: "Owner withdrawal classified as expense by both classifier and corrector"
Reasoning: Agent 1 misclassified. Agent 3 didn't catch it. Root cause is Agent 1.
Output: {"decision": "FIX", "fix_plans": [{"agent": 1, "fix_context": "Owner withdrawals are dividend increases (slot b), not expense increases (slot c). Ownership structure is sole proprietor."}]}
</example>

<example>
Rejection: "Both debit and credit tuples seem wrong — revenue classified as liability on credit side and expense on debit side for what appears to be a simple cash sale"
Reasoning: Both classifiers (Agent 1 and 2) misclassified. Two root causes.
Output: {"decision": "FIX", "fix_plans": [{"agent": 1, "fix_context": "Cash received from sale is asset increase (slot a)"}, {"agent": 2, "fix_context": "Sales revenue is revenue increase (slot c), not a new liability"}]}
</example>

<example>
Rejection: "Investment recorded at cost+fees but classification \
determines whether fees should be expensed"
Reasoning: The classification is genuinely ambiguous — no agent \
misclassified. The transaction does not state management's intent.
Output: {"decision": "STUCK", "fix_plans": [], \
"stuck_reason": "Investment classification (FVTPL vs FVOCI vs \
equity method) depends on management intent, not stated in the \
transaction. No agent can resolve this — clarification needed \
from the user."}
