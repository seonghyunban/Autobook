# Post-Hoc Evaluation Prompts

Evaluate experiment results. Write evaluation JSON files into each variant's result directory.

---

## 1. Entry Accuracy Evaluation

For each variant directory in `results/<experiment>/`, read every `*.json` file starting with `basic_*` or `int_*` (56 non-ambiguous test cases). Compare the `journal_entry` field against the expected entry. Write one `entry_accuracy.json` per variant directory.

### Scoring

For each test case, produce two scores:

1. **match** — Does the actual journal entry match the expected entry? Use your accounting judgment to determine if accounts are semantically equivalent. Amounts must be exact (allow minor rounding on present value calculations).

2. **tax_relaxed_match** — Same comparison, but if the only differences are tax-related (added/removed tax lines of any kind — HST, GST, VAT, sales tax — or amounts adjusted for tax), would an accountant consider the actual entry to be a realistic and correct treatment?

### Output

Write one file per variant: `results/<experiment>/<variant>/entry_accuracy.json`

```json
{
  "evaluator": "claude",
  "evaluated_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "prompt_version": "v4",
  "results": {
    "test_case_id": {
      "match": true,
      "tax_relaxed_match": true,
      "reason": "brief explanation"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Clarification Relevance Evaluation

For each variant directory, read the 5 files starting with `hard_*`. Evaluate whether the pipeline correctly identified the ambiguity and asked a useful clarification question. Write one `clarification_relevance.json` per variant directory.

### Expected Ambiguities

**hard_01_note_discounting** — Derecognition (sale of receivable) vs Collateralized borrowing (loan secured by receivable)
**hard_02_investment_classification** — FVTPL (short-term trading) vs FVOCI (long-term strategic) vs Equity method (significant influence)
**hard_27_meal_purpose** — Overtime meal vs Working meeting vs Client entertainment vs Factory staff meal (production overhead)
**hard_32_grocery_purpose** — Client entertainment vs Employee break room supplies
**hard_16_rent_treatment** — Prepaid asset vs Immediate expense (short-term lease exemption)

### Scoring

**relevant = true** when ALL hold:
1. `final_decision` = "INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION"
2. At least one clarification question was produced
3. The question distinguishes between the listed interpretations
4. The question is about business facts, not accounting treatment

**relevant = false** otherwise.

### Output

Write one file per variant: `results/<experiment>/<variant>/clarification_relevance.json`

```json
{
  "evaluator": "claude",
  "evaluated_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "prompt_version": "v4",
  "results": {
    "test_case_id": {
      "actual_decision": "...",
      "actual_questions": ["..."],
      "expected_cases": ["..."],
      "relevant": true,
      "reason": "brief explanation"
    }
  }
}
```

## Parallel Evaluation

Run 6 agents in parallel to evaluate all 61 test cases:

| Agent | Task | Cases |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Entry accuracy — basic | basic_01 through basic_15 (15 cases) |
| 2 | Entry accuracy — intermediate batch 1 | int_03 through int_15 (10 cases) |
| 3 | Entry accuracy — intermediate batch 2 | int_17 through int_26a (10 cases) |
| 4 | Entry accuracy — intermediate batch 3 | int_26b through int_hard_02c (10 cases) |
| 5 | Entry accuracy — intermediate batch 4 | int_hard_27a through int_hard_16b (11 cases) |
| 6 | Clarification relevance | hard_01 through hard_32 (5 cases) |

Each agent:
1. Reads result files from `results/<experiment>/<variant>/`
2. Compares `journal_entry` (or `final_decision` + `clarification_questions`) against expected
3. Writes a separate evaluation file to `results/<experiment>/<variant>/evaluation/`:
   - Agent 1: `eval_entry_basic.json`
   - Agent 2: `eval_entry_int_batch1.json`
   - Agent 3: `eval_entry_int_batch2.json`
   - Agent 4: `eval_entry_int_batch3.json`
   - Agent 5: `eval_entry_int_batch4.json`
   - Agent 6: `eval_clarification.json`

After all agents complete, run merge script:
```bash
./run_merge_eval.sh --experiment <name> --variant <variant>
```
This merges the partial files from `evaluation/` into:
- `results/<experiment>/<variant>/entry_accuracy.json` (agents 1-5 merged)
- `results/<experiment>/<variant>/clarification_relevance.json` (agent 6 renamed)

## Workflow

1. `./run_experiment.sh` — runs pipeline, saves result JSONs
2. Evaluate using this prompt with parallel agents — write `entry_accuracy.json` + `clarification_relevance.json` per variant
3. `./run_analysis.sh` — merges evaluation files, computes metrics
4. `./run_present.sh` — generates report
