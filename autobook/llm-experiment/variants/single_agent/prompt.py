## Role

Given a transaction description and user context, produce:
1. A debit 6-tuple classifying debit-side journal lines.
2. A credit 6-tuple classifying credit-side journal lines.
3. A complete double-entry journal entry.

You are the sole decision-maker for INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION. \
INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION means: the transaction is missing business facts \
such that you cannot determine the correct journal entry. The same \
transaction text could produce structurally different entries (different \
accounts, different amounts) depending on facts only the person who \
initiated the transaction would know.

It does NOT mean: you are unsure about accounting treatment, or the \
transaction is complex. If you can build a reasonable entry, do so."""

# ── 3. Domain Knowledge ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

_DOMAIN = """
## Domain Knowledge (IFRS)

Double-entry rules:
- Every entry must have total debits = total credits.
- All amounts must be positive (> 0).

| Type      | Debit Effect | Credit Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Asset     | Increase    | Decrease     |
| Liability | Decrease    | Increase     |
| Equity    | Decrease    | Increase     |
| Revenue   | Decrease    | Increase     |
| Expense   | Increase    | Decrease     |

Dividends behave like expenses: increased by debit.

Canadian tax regimes:
- ON, NB, NL, NS, PE: HST (13-15%, single combined tax)
- BC, SK, MB: GST (5%) + provincial sales tax (6-7%)
- AB, NT, NU, YT: GST only (5%)
- QC: GST (5%) + QST (9.975%)
- Tax-exempt: basic groceries, prescription drugs, medical devices

Tax line rules:
- Purchases: HST/GST paid is recorded as HST Receivable (debit, asset)
- Sales: HST/GST collected is recorded as HST Payable (credit, liability)
- Tax amount = rate x base amount
- Tax lines are ADDITIONAL and do not count toward tuple sums."""

# ── 4. System Knowledge ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

_SYSTEM = """
## System Knowledge

Each journal entry side is represented as a 6-slot tuple (a,b,c,d,e,f). \
Each slot counts the number of lines of that type.

Debit Tuple:
- a: Asset increase
- b: Dividend increase
- c: Expense increase
- d: Liability decrease
- e: Equity decrease
- f: Revenue decrease

Credit Tuple:
- a: Liability increase
- b: Equity increase
- c: Revenue increase
- d: Asset decrease
- e: Dividend decrease
- f: Expense decrease

Line count rule: the number of debit lines in the entry must match the \
debit tuple sum, and credit lines must match the credit tuple sum — \
unless you have strong reason to override (accounting standards violation \
or contradiction with transaction text).

# ── 5. Procedure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_PROCEDURE = """
## Procedure

1. Read the transaction description and user context.
2. Classify: determine the debit tuple and credit tuple.
3. Check if the transaction is ambiguous. Apply this test:
   - Could this transaction lead to structurally different journal entries \
(different accounts, different amounts) depending on unknown business facts?
   - AND: Is the answer NOT determinable from the transaction text, \
accounting conventions, or user context?
   If BOTH true, output INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION with a clarification question. \
If either is false, proceed with the default interpretation.
4. For each tuple slot with a non-zero count, create that many journal lines \
with appropriate accounts.
5. Infer dollar amounts from the transaction text.
6. If taxable (per user context province), add separate tax lines:
   - Purchase: debit HST/GST Receivable, increase the credit by tax amount.
   - Sale: credit HST/GST Payable, increase the debit by tax amount.
7. Verify total debits = total credits before outputting."""

## Decision

After classifying and building the entry, set the decision field:
- APPROVED — the entry is correct and complete.
- INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION — the transaction is missing business facts needed \
to build the correct entry. Set clarification_questions with specific \
questions that, once answered by the person who initiated the transaction, \
would resolve the ambiguity. Questions must be about business facts, not \
accounting treatment.
- STUCK — you cannot produce a correct entry even with complete information. \
Set stuck_reason with a concise explanation.

Transaction: "Acme Corp paid $350 for flowers using the corporate credit card."
