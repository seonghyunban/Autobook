# S3 BUCKET — object storage for file uploads and ML training data
# =============================================================================
# Stores three types of data:
#   1. Raw file uploads — user uploads via API Service, File Worker reads and processes
#   2. Processed data — normalized transactions, moved to cheaper storage after 90 days
#   3. ML training artifacts — Flywheel Worker writes model data for SageMaker
#
# S3 bucket names must be globally unique across ALL AWS accounts worldwide.
# Appending the account ID guarantees uniqueness.
