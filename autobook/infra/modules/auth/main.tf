# COGNITO USER POOL — the user directory
# =============================================================================
# A user pool is like a database of user accounts managed by AWS.
# Users sign up with email + password, Cognito handles:
#   - Account creation and verification
#   - Password hashing and storage
#   - Login and token issuance (JWT tokens)
#   - Password reset flows
#   - MFA (multi-factor authentication)
#
# Our backend authorization policy uses Cognito groups as the app role claim.
# Every authenticated user can be mapped to one of:
#   - regular
#   - manager
#   - superuser
