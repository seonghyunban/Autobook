# SQS QUEUES — message passing between the 8 ECS services
# =============================================================================
# Autobook uses a 4-tier cascade (cache → model → LLM → human) where each
# tier is an independent ECS service. Services communicate by passing messages
# through SQS queues — the API enqueues, workers dequeue, process, and enqueue
# to the next queue. SQS is fully managed: no servers, no brokers, no Redis
# BRPOP loops. Messages are durable (replicated across AZs), and if a worker
# crashes mid-processing, the message reappears after the visibility timeout.
#
# 7 queues, one per handoff point in the pipeline:
#   normalization — API → Normalization worker (raw text → graph)
#   precedent    — Normalization → Precedent Matcher (normalized transaction)
#   ml_inference — Precedent Matcher → ML Inference (cache miss)
#   agent        — ML Inference → Agent (low-confidence classification)
#   resolution   — Agent → Resolution Worker (stuck/fixable → human)
#   posting      — All tier workers → Posting Service (validated journal entry)
#   flywheel     — Posting Service → Flywheel Worker (learning feedback)
#
# Each queue has a dead-letter queue (DLQ) that catches messages that fail
# processing repeatedly. This prevents poison messages from looping forever
# and gives you a place to inspect failures.

  # If the worker doesn't delete the message within this time, SQS makes it
  # visible again for another worker to retry. Must be longer than your

  # with retries, so 30s gives plenty of headroom.
